    "## Chapter 7\n",
    "### Graphs and Graph Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "* Trees are a type of graph\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Vocabulary\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Vertex** (**node**): fundamental part of a graph. It can have a name (**key**) and also additional information (**payload** or **value**).\n",
    "2. **Edge** (**arc**): conncts two vertices to show a relationship between them. May be one-way (**directed graph** or **digraph**) or two-way.\n",
    "3. **Weight**: edges may be weighted to show the cost of going from one vertex to another.\n",
    "4. **Path**: a sequence of vertices that are connected by edges. Formally defined as $w_1, w_2,...,w_n$ such that $(w_i,w_{i+1}) \\in E$ for all $1 \\le i \\le n-1$. The unweighted path length is the number of edges in path, specifically $n-1$. The weighted path length is the sum of the weights of all the edges in the path.\n",
    "5. **Cycle**: A cycle in a directed graph is a path that starts and ends at the same vertex. A graph with no cycles is called an **acyclic graph**. A directed graph with no cycles is likewise called a **directed acyclic graph** or **DAG**. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Formal Definition of a Graph\n",
    "\n",
    "A graph $G$ where $G = (V,E)$. $V$ and $E$ are sets of vertices and edges, respectively. Each edge is a tuple $(v,w)$ where $w,v \\in V$. A third value may be added to the tuple to represent weight. A subgraph $s$ is a set of edges $e$ and vertices $v$ such that $e \\subset E$ and $v \\subset V$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Graph Abstract Data Type\n",
    "\n",
    "Defined as follows:\n",
    "* <span style=\"color:red;background-color:#fdf\">Graph()</span> creates a new, empty graph. \n",
    "* <span style=\"color:red;background-color:#fdf\">addVertex(vert)</span> adds an instance of <span style=\"color:red;background-color:#fdf\">Vertex</span> to the graph.\n",
    "* <span style=\"color:red;background-color:#fdf\">addEdge(fromVert, toVert)</span> adds a new, directed edge to the graph that connects two vertices.\n",
    "* <span style=\"color:red;background-color:#fdf\">addEdge(fromVert, toVert, weight</span> adds a new, weighted edge to the graph.\n",
    "* <span style=\"color:red;background-color:#fdf\">getVertex(vertKey)</span> finds the vertex in the graph named <span style=\"color:red;background-color:#fdf\">vertKey</span>.\n",
    "* <span style=\"color:red;background-color:#fdf\">getVertices()</span> returns the list of all vertices in the graph.\n",
    "* <span style=\"color:red;background-color:#fdf\">in</span> returns <span style=\"color:red;background-color:#fdf\">True</span> for a statement of the form <span style=\"color:red;background-color:#fdf\">vertex in graph</span>, if the given vertex is in the graph, <span style=\"color:red;background-color:#fdf\">False</span> otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### An Adjacency Matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "This method uses a two dimensional matrix to represent a graph. Each column and row represents a vertex. The value that is stored in the intersection of row $v$ and column $w$ indicates if there is an edge from vertex $v$ to vertex $w$. When two vertices are connected by an edge they are said to be adjacent. The value in a cell may represent the weight of the edge.\n",
    "\n",
    "| | V0 | V1 | V2 | V3 | V4 | V5 |\n",
    "| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n",
    "| V0 | | 5 | | | | 2 |\n",
    "| V1 |  |  | 4 |  |  |  |\n",
    "| V2 |  |  |  | 9 |  |  |\n",
    "| V3 |  |  |  |  | 7 | 3 |\n",
    "| V4 | 1 |  |  |  |  |  |\n",
    "| V5 |  |  | 1 |  | 8 |  |\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem with this method is that the matrix tends to be quite sparse and thus is an inefficient use of storage\n",
    "\n",
    "#### An Adjacency List\n",
    "\n",
    "In an adjacency list implementation, a list of all the vertices in the graph object is kept, and each vertex object in the graph maintains a list of all of the other vertices that it is connected to. A vertex object could, for example, contain class variables as a string to represent the vertex's name and a dictionary to hold the other vertex objects it is connected to and the edge weights. <span style=\"color:red;background-color:#fdf\">V0.id = \"V0\"</span> and <span style=\"color:red;background-color:#fdf\">V0.adj = {V2:1, V4:8}</span> Thus an adjacency list efficiently represents a sparse graph and allows us to easily find all of the links that are connected to a particular vertex.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "We will create two classes: <span style=\"color:red;background-color:#fdf\">Graph</span>, which contains the master list of vertices; and <span style=\"color:red;background-color:#fdf\">Vertex</span>, which will represent each vertex in the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each <span style=\"color:red;background-color:#fdf\">Vertex</span> will maintain a dictionary, <span style=\"color:red;background-color:#fdf\">connectedTo</span>, containing which other vertices it is connected to as well as the edge weights. Below is the code for this class. The <span style=\"color:red;background-color:#fdf\">id</span> is typically a string. The <span style=\"color:red;background-color:#fdf\">addNeighboor</span> method is used to add a connection. <span style=\"color:red;background-color:#fdf\">getConnections</span> returns all of the vertices in the adjacency list, as represented by the <span style=\"color:red;background-color:#fdf\">connectedTo</span> variable. <span style=\"color:red;background-color:#fdf\">getWeight</span> returns the weight between this vertex and the one passed as a parameter"

    "#### The Word Ladder Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "In the word ladder problem, you must change one word into another by changing one letter at a time. At each step the word must remain a valid word. Consider the words \"fool\" and \"sage\":\n",

    "\n",
    "* representing the relationships between the words as graphs\n",
    "* using the graph algorithm known as breadth first search to find an efficient path from the starting word to the ending word.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Building the word ladder graph\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to solve the problem, we need to turn a collection of words into a graph. We would like to have an edge from one word to another when they are different only by a single letter. In this case, an undirected graph without edge-weighting is appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "We start with the assumption that every word is of the same length. Next we create a vertex for every word. To create the edges we could compare every word with each other, forming an edge when the difference is one character, but this would lead to $n^2$ comparisons.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead we will use a bucket approach. Each bucket represents a word with one of the characters replaced by an underscore; `POOL` becomes `_OOL` for example. Now every word that matches the last three characters can be placed in this bucket. In this case `FOOL`, `COOL`, etc would be in this bucket. Then an edge can be created between each vertex in the bucket.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will implement this scheme with a dictionary, and the bucket labels will be the keys. The values are lists of words stored in those buckets. Once the dictionary is in place we can build the graph by first creating a vertex for each word and then edges between all vertices in the same buckets. "

Imagining BFS as building a tree, it adds all the children of the starting vertex before it begins to discover any of the grandchildren.\n",
    "\n",
    "To keep track of progress, BFS colors each vertex with white, grey, or black. Vertices are initialized to white (undiscovered). The color is changed to grey when the vertex is initially discovered and to black when it has been fully explored.\n",

    "\n",

    "1. The new unexplored vertex `nbr` is colored grey.\n",
    "2. The predecessor is set to the `currentVert`.\n",
    "3. The distance to `nbr` is set as the distance to the `currentVert + 1`.\n",
